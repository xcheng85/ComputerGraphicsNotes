Least Square issue



two points determin a line

2 unknown 2 linear equation cramer rule 


3 points 

2 unknown, 

approximation 

overdetermined system

least square solution

derivative = 0 




line: 

two forms: 
1. implicit form:  positive / negative space 
2. parameterized form: coding

converting between two forms


Triangles: 

How to figure out the order of each triangle  ? 


det of a matrix 

it also represents signed area of triangle

parametric form
barycentric form 


Rectangles: 

parametric form

symmetric form : code 

center , direction, extent 

Polylines: 

Polygons: 

concave

convex

2d polygon code: 

how to test polygon is simple polygon ? 

neighboring edges does not intersect each other

how to test polygon is convex polygon ?

iterate every vertex and they are aloways on the same pos/neg side of edge composed with neighboring vertexs. 

Quatric curve can represent following type: 

1. circle 

parametric form: 
quatric form

3d space circle

center, normal and radius

2. ellipses
parametric form 
X = C + e0*cos(t)*A0 + e1*sin(t)*A1



AlignedBox: aabb

use min and max to represent

Obb: 
center
axis 
extent
